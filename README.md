# bash_helpers

Utilities for Bash, e.g. commands and aliases I like to use or have written

Some of this is specific to Mac now to accomodate work laptops as opposed to VMs,
but everything should be cross compatible (?)


## Setup:

```
ln -s ~/workspace/bash_helpers/_.bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

Mac OS X
```
ln -s ~/workspace/bash_helpers/_.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile

ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl ~/bin/subl
```
