# bash_helpers

Utilities for Bash, e.g. commands and aliases I like to use or have written

Some of this is specific to Mac now to accomodate work laptops as opposed to VMs,
but everything should be cross compatible (?)


## Setup:

```
ln -s ~/workspace/bash_helpers/_.bashrc ~/.bashrc
ln -s ~/workspace/bash_helpers/_.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile

```
